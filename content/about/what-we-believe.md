## The Doctrinal Statement of FBBC

### Scripture

We believe that all Scripture was given by verbal, complete and inerrant inspiration of God (2 Timothy 3:16) and that God has promised to preserve every jot and tittle of what He inspired (Matthew 5:18). We hold to the Authorized Version (King James Bible) as the standard for English speaking people and believe that we find within it the certainty of the words of truth (Proverbs 22:20–21).

### God

We believe in one true God who is manifest in three eternal Persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit (1 John 5:7; Matthew 3:16–17; 28:19).

### Jesus Christ

We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is fully and literally God in human form (1 Timothy 3:16), that He was conceived of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35), and in the womb of the virgin named Mary (Isaiah 7:14) received a human body. We believe that He was tempted by Satan in all points like as we are (Matthew 4:1–11; Hebrews 4:15; 1 John 2:16). We believe that He allowed Himself to be crucified in order to pay the penalty deserved for all man’s sin (Romans 5:11–21) and that He literally and bodily rose again from the grave on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:3–4) and that He now sits on the right hand of the Father in heaven (Colossians 3:1).

### Holy Spirit

We believe that the Holy Spirit is fully God and the current, earthly manifestation of God through His indwelling of the believer in the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 3:16; John 16:7) and that He seals the believer and baptizes (immerses) him into the Body of Christ at the moment of salvation (1 Corinthians 12:13), with the goal of teaching God’s Word and conforming the believer to the very image of Christ (Ephesians 1:3–14; 1 Corinthians 2:9–16; 2 Corinthians 3:17–18). We believe that all the spiritual blessings are received at the time of salvation (Ephesians 1:3) and that the Spirit gives gifts to every believer as He (the Holy Spirit) wills, so that the believer might effectively communicate the love of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13) and that the modern tongues movement is not according to Scripture (1 Corinthians 14).

### Satan

We believe that Satan is a real, historical being, a fallen cherub who was lifted up in pride and rebelled against God, leading an army of angelic beings with him (Isaiah 14:12–17). His defeat was sealed by the work of Christ on the Cross (Hebrews 2:14). His final destiny is the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:10).

### Creation and Sin

We believe that the Genesis account of creation is historical, not allegorical or figurative. We believe that Adam was an historical person, created by the direct act of God and in His image (Genesis 12). Adam chose to sin against God through the free will God gave him and reaped the wages of death. As the originator of the human race, Adam passed his sinful nature to all mankind (Romans 5:12). All men are sinners by birth and become sinners in experience (Romans 3) for which the wages are death (Romans 6:23).

### Salvation

We believe that salvation is by God’s grace alone on the basis of the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross and in His resurrection, appropriated by the faith of anyone who will personally believe in his heart and confess with his mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 10:9–10). We believe that the act of salvation is just as definite and decisive as physical birth (John 3:17). We believe that this salvation cannot be reversed or lost and that believers are kept by the power of God (John 10:28–29; 1 John 2:19; Romans 8:35–39; 1 Peter 1:5).

### The Church

We believe that the local assembly of believers (church) is God’s instrument in this age. While all genuine, born again believers in Christ share an organic, family relationship, the overwhelming number of references of the word “church” in the Bible apply to the local, visible assembly of believers (Acts 14:23; Ephesians 1:22–23; 4:11–16; 1 Timothy 3:1–13) At the Second Coming of Christ all genuine believers from the time of Christ’s ascension will be united together as the Body of Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; Revelation 19:7–8; 21:2). Until then, it is the responsibility of each local church to continue in evangelism, discipleship and missions both independently and interdependently (Matthew 28:18–20). We believe that each local assembly should be self-governing, self-supporting and self-propagating as possible, practicing the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s Table, and operate under the leadership of those who hold the office of pastor (also known as “bishop” or “elder”) and assisted by those who hold the office of deacon (Matthew 28:18–20; 1 Corinthians 11:23–34; 1 Timothy 3:1–13; 1 Peter 5:14; Hebrews 13:17). We believe that every member of the local church has the responsibility to minister the Word of God and support the ministry through prayer, holy living, tithes and offerings (1 Corinthians 16:2; Malachi 3:10; Acts 4:34–37; 2 Corinthians 8:7; Acts 2:41–47; 13:14).

### Second Coming

We believe in the literal, physical return of Jesus Christ to the earth in power and great glory to judge the world and reign (Acts 1:11; 2 Thessalonians 1:7–10). We believe that shortly before Christ’s Second Coming all genuine believers will be raptured out to meet the Lord in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; 1 Corinthians 15:51–52), followed by a seven year period of tribulation on the earth during which time God will judge His people, Israel, and all without Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:1–11; Matthew 24). That period of tribulation will be ended by Christ’s personal return to rule for a thousand years (Revelation 20:16; Matthew 25:31–46).

### Eternity

We believe that all men will spend eternity either with Christ or eternally separated from Him. We believe that the lost who die wait in a literal Hell for the day of final judgment where they will be assigned to the proper degree of punishment in a literal Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11–15). We believe that those who have accepted Christ as Savior will experience a bodily resurrection to everlasting life (1 Thessalonians 4:13–18; 1 Corinthians 15:51–58).
